&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Q:** Who are you?  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**A:** I am Kairos, conqueror of all.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Q:** Why do you stand on tip‚Äëtoe?  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**A:** I am always running.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Q:** And why have wings upon your feet?  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**A:** I fly with the wind.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Q:** And why do you hold a razor in your right hand?  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**A:** As a sign to men that I am sharper than any sharp edge.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Q:** And why does your hair hang over your face?  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**A:** For him who meets me to take me by the forelock.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Q:** And why, in Heaven's name, is the back of your head bald?  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**A:** Because none whom I have once raced by on my winged feet will now,     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;though he wishes it sore, take hold of me from behind.
